<p>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:<br/>

Revision Films aims to raise up future film-makers who hold tight to the teachings of Jesus Christ and desire to have a positive impact on our culture.  Revision Films will educate, train, and empower young people to use their gifts and change the world, one story at a time.

Christian Consulates was founded in 2010 and developed more specifically as Revision Films in 2012 by Chad and Tami Kerr to use innovative methods in educating  Lorain County youth from age 10 to young adulthood in Christian values, leadership and fine arts. Focusing on the various aspects of film-making, Revision employs solid educational techniques to help youth explore and develop their talents. Revision desires to inspire youth to think critically not only to effectively develop excellent films, but also in how to use their creative and leadership skills, their films and their influence to better their communities. Films with positive content and family entertainment along with local history documentaries and legacy videos allow students to take advantage of a powerful media platform.

In 2013, Carlos Gonzalez, owner of Line 10 Entertainment, came in as film instructor and directed the students' first short film, August Woods, which premiered in 2014 at the Apollo Theater in Oberlin, Ohio. The process included the students' writing the script, acting and using professional  film-making cameras and techniques. While Mr. Gonzalez edited the primary film, students followed his example in videoing and editing a documentary about their movie-making experience. Also in 2014, Revision Films moved to meet in a more central location at Calvary Baptist Church, Elyria, Ohio.

Revision meets twice a month for approximately three hours in which the youth are led through a biblically-based lesson and life-application discussion reviewing a movie clip, or listen to a guest speaker from the film industry. Then, they are given instruction in specific aspects of film-making and put into small groups with an assignment to use what they learned. Each group has cameras, props, a timetable and suggestions to help them complete the assignment. Once finished, the groups return and share their work with everyone, together reviewing and discussing the film-making elements.

Revision is currently developing a one-year curriculum which will take students through the basics of film-making while they work in small groups applying each technique. The curriculum finale leads the students in making their own short film. As students become more familiar with the process, they will be established as mentors and small group leaders for the upcoming youth. Revision's additional goals involve helping churches around the county and nation train up youth in the media fields by franchising the program. We also hope to create a web-development  avenue and a game-app avenue that mimic the educational opportunity of film-making we provide.

Revision Films values and invests in youth through education and the arts to guide and empower those youth to invest in their world.
